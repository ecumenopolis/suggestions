# Ethics

Ethics is a study of what a person should do in any given circumstance so as to maximize human flourishing.  Per our goals this topic should be of particular interest.  Unfortunately, defining Ethic has been elusive for humanity.  This is because there are so many categorically different circumstances in which a people can find themselves. Additionally, particularly smart people like to find a way to justify their less-than-perfect actions to others -- even when they know they should have acted differently. This is to avoid social shame, or some external punishment.  However, most punishment from acting less-than-perfect is usually manifest in the world without the need for specific human intervention. 

For example, if you touch a hot stove, nobody need tell you that you've done something wrong! Your hand hurts all on its own. Most other rules that people should follow are like this, though their consequences take longer to show up.  Maybe, for example, you're just rude to people routinely, and eventually you're left old, without friends, and bitter because of it.  If you're routinely lazy, your life starts to yield nothing of benefit to you.

These long-term consequences make it difficult for us, as humans, to learn what to do (and not do) before irreversible damage has done to our lives. Therefore, most of the world religions and law systems have some basic heuristics to try to help us act in a manner which is best for us, and for our community. In order to get others to follow these rules, leaders have historically appealed to God's authority and all-seeing-eye to get children to follow the rules. The implication is: "If you don't follow the rules, God might do something bad to you. If you do follow the rules, God might reward you!"

# Should and should not

In the age we are writing, most people no longer believe in "God." (Although, most people don't even seem to agree on what that word means) So, many philosophers have sought repeatedly to define ethics rigorously, and without an appeal to the supernatural. However, the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) has been thus farm immovable to philosophers.  This “problem” is an observation that you cannot create an imperative for how people should act, by observing what things are. You cannot tell people what they *should* be doing, based on what *is.*  Thus, it seems that defining [a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori) morality is hopeless.

However, a concept of ethics *has* been indispensable in keeping societies together.  Indeed, most human cultures have codified ethics in the form which we call the "golden rule."  In English, this rule is expressed "do to others what you would have them do to you."  A more explicit paraphrasing of this rule is "do to other people what you would expect them to do to you if the circumstances were reversed."

However, sometimes this rule can be confusing.  Children ask “why should anyone be punished? I wouldn’t like to be punished if I do something wrong!  Therefor I should not be punished, nor punish.” However, as any father knows, punishment is there to bring consequences forward in time so that a child may learn that the natural consequences of their actions would be bad, had they been left to their own devices.  Yet, many other confusing circumstances remain for individuals who would not already do what the rule intends to instruct.

# Universalizability

The philosopher Immanuel Kant attempted to make this rule more concrete, and to give it imperative weight, with the idea of "universalizability." You should only do something if its maxim (the intent behind the action) can be applied universally (or equally) to all people in the same situation.  It being our intent to maximize freedom, it seems good that whatever rules we do choose to impose upon ourselves, everyone else could follow as well (if they wanted).

Another point that Kant makes is that humans are not a means-to-an end, but they are always an ends in themselves.  This is to say that other people have the same intrinsic value we do, and are not just valuable in what they can help us accomplish.  Given that we hold that no human is more intrinsically valuable than any other (although they may have different skills and deficits), we also find this poignant.  Many world religions express this by saying that humans were created in the [likeness of God.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_of_God)

# Action in the moment

Indeed, if we believe that every human is equally intrinsically valuable, then universalizability makes even more sense.  However, applying universalizability comes from from reason, and as humans our reason is often faulty or ill-informed. Evolution has trained us best for tasks other than correct rational thought. If we were required to think rigorously before we do any action, we would never accomplish anything at all.

Therefore, humans have historically used heuristics to inform them as to what they should do in a particular situation to get a reasonably good result (you can never be sure of perfection anyways.)  These heuristics have come from observing people in society for long periods of time and waiting to see if we can identify any commonalities.  If a subgroup of people who often perform the same action have some common consequence, we have historically said that “God’s wrath” or “God’s blessing” is upon those people for that action.

These observations have been imperfect, and without rigor.  Yet, they have been useful in keeping us safe (“If you eat that type of food, you’ll probably get sick.”)  Sometimes, they result in mis-attributing the true source of the problem, and causing us to collectively perform silly behaviors.

However, at the time of writing we have developed rigorous observational techniques and analysis we call [statistical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics#Observational_study) and via the field of [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology). This has shown, for example, that smoking increases your risk of getting lung cancer by a wide margin.  That is to say, you may not get lung cancer, but you probably will.  Our ancestors would have said “God’s wrath is upon you for smoking.”

However, these studies have been mainly limited to concrete scientific subjects.  We hope that we can apply them to imperative maxims in the future.  In doing so, they should be codified in this book with citations so that our children can be fully aware of their likely results of things they choose to do.

Armed with an understanding of these likely results, we can pick the ones which that best suite our goal of creating a society where ever human has maximum opportunity.  A society where resources are allocated most efficiently, and where violence and scarcity are eliminated.

Maybe this is what people always meant when they write of God's will?
