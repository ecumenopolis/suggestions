# The Book

Good tidings, you have found the most important, albeit imperfect, book in existence. This book is intended to be the minimum viable book -- the book that every person should read. It contains information ordered from most important, to least important. The information contained herein is critical for the safe operation of humanity. Those individuals who read and understand this book will be blessed more than their wildest dreams.

Good processes yield good results, and bad processes yield bad results. In order to develop the best process, you must first write down what you are doing, and then progressively improve upon it as you determine where your process is failing you.

The most important process are daily rituals. Your ritual practices produce your future. If you want to produce the best possible future, you need to adopt the best possible rituals.

As such, this book focuses first on those rituals. We will enumerate them, and together we will iterate on them. This book is not yet complete, and can only ever be a suggestion.

No two people are the same, and no two persons rituals should be the same either. However, humans share more in common than they differ. As such, most things should be the same. Is there anyone who can forgo eating and still live?
