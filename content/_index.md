# The Book

1. Knowing where to find good information is the most important thing a person can know. This book strives to be the compendium of the most important things, and thus the most important (albeit imperfect and incomplete) book. It is intended to be the minimum viable book -- the book that every person should read. Herein, the information contained is ordered from greatest to least important as it pertains to producing Life for the reader. Those individuals who read and understand this book will be blessed more than their wildest dreams.
1. Good processes yield good results, and bad processes yield bad results. In order to develop the best process, you must first write down what you are doing, and then progressively improve upon it as you learn more about where your process is failing. As such, this book should be progressively improved by all its readers.
1. The most important process are daily rituals. Your ritual practices produce your future. If you want to produce the best possible future, you need to adopt the best possible rituals. This book focuses on information that pertains to those rituals.
1. No two people are the same, and no two persons rituals should be the same either. However, humans share more in common than they differ. As such, most things should be the same. Is there anyone who can forgo eating and still live?
