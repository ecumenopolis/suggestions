# A Vision For Us

The goal of this project is to maximize human flourishing, and minimize human suffering.  We believe that we can accomplish this by seeking to maximize human freedom.  Maximizing human freedom allows each personâ€™s wisdom and discernment to be productive in society to maximal effect.  We know this is necessary due to the examples of the [coordination problem](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl.html?chapter_num=2#book-reader), and the [economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem).

We believe that we can maximize human freedom, and flourishing, by voluntarily taking upon ourselves some personal commitments.  We recognize that we know only a little.  Therefore we do not seek to create perfection, but only to create an agreement which works for us as individuals  We hope that it will work for everyone else as well.

We will accomplish this goal by choosing our commitments carefully through an understanding of the latest research in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), [human psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), and knowledge of history and past successes and failures.

We believe that the majority of people should be able to knowing and voluntarily accept these commitments for themselves with full understanding of their meanings.  This document should be intelligible by the majority of individuals, and be read and understood within a few weeks.  Therefore, we should seek to minimize the complexity of this document, while providing as many references as possible for those more curious about rationale.

Additionally, as the need arises, this document can and should be amended individually and shared with others.  The ability for change is important because of changes in language over time, and due to [semantic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change).  Many other attempts at writing a covenant like this have failed in the long term due to a failure to adapt and the development of [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism) around semantically drifted words.  Thus this document will be maintained in unicode, and maintained in a version control system such as git.  In this way, forks can be made, and changes reviewed with rationale by anyone who seeks to better understanding what they are taking upon themselves.

We have chosen the name `The Book of Ecumenopolis` because we seek to create a common citizenry.  Ecumenopolis means "world city."  In order to accomplish this vision, we seek to create a common set of laws which everyone can commit to themselves to follow.

The primary mechanism by which we will improve the human condition is by creating a voluntary system of rules and values which are result in clear and direct human action.   These rules should create a [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) whereby everyone will voluntarily follow these commitments.  The commitments should ensure that [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good)  are paid for and produced in reasonable proportion to the total economic activity, and that a set of laws that can be agreed upon and followed by two standard deviations worth of the population (95%).
