# A Vision For Us

The goal of this project is to maximize human flourishing, and minimize human suffering.  We believe that we can accomplish this by seeking to maximize human freedom.  Maximizing human freedom allows each person’s wisdom and discernment to be productive in society to maximal effect.  We know this is necessary due to the examples of the [coordination problem](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl.html?chapter_num=2#book-reader), and the [economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem).

We believe that we can maximize human freedom, and flourishing, by voluntarily taking upon ourselves some personal commitments.  We recognize that we know only a little.  Therefore we do not seek to create perfection, but only to create an agreement which works for us as individuals  We hope that it will work for everyone else as well.

We will accomplish this goal by choosing our commitments carefully through an understanding of the latest research in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), [human psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), and knowledge of history and past successes and failures.

We believe that the majority of people should be able to knowing and voluntarily accept these commitments for themselves with full understanding of their meanings.  This document should be intelligible by the majority of individuals, and be read and understood within a few weeks.  Therefore, we should seek to minimize the complexity of this document, while providing as many references as possible for those more curious about rationale.

Additionally, as the need arises, this document can and should be amended individually and shared with others.  The ability for change is important because of changes in language over time, and due to [semantic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change).  Many other attempts at writing a covenant like this have failed in the long term due to a failure to adapt and the development of [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism) around semantically drifted words.  Thus this document will be maintained in unicode, and maintained in a version control system such as git.  In this way, forks can be made, and changes reviewed with rationale by anyone who seeks to better understanding what they are taking upon themselves.

We have chosen the name `Ama-gi project` because the word Ama-gi is from one of the oldest known languages.  It means "to return to the mother" and it represented the concern of returning a slave to their family, and the forgiveness of their debts.

The primary mechanism by which we will improve the human condition is by creating a voluntary system of rules and values which are result in clear and direct human action.   These rules should create a [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) whereby everyone will voluntarily follow these commitments.  The commitments should ensure that [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good)  are paid for and produced in reasonable proportion to the total economic activity, and that a set of laws that can be agreed upon and followed by two standard deviations worth of the population (95%).

## Intolerance

Nassem Talib has made a convincing argument for what he calls the [dictatorship of the minority](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15).  The basic premise is that if a minority of individuals within an economy is intolerant of products which do not meet certain requirements, and the rest do not have a preference, then all products will eventually meet these standards provided the cost to meet the standards does not outweigh the additional profit gained by serving 100% of the market.  He writes:

The minority rule will show us how it all it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly.

Therefore, those of us who take the commitment of this document should prefer to trade with others who have done the same.  They can do this in the form of giving discounts to people who can prove they are following these commitments.  This can be done through a cryptographically proveable membership card to a public goods administration which you choose to recognize.  Any public goods administration will do, provided it meets requirements that are laid out in a later section specifically on the operation of public goods administrations.

## Public Goods Administrations

The goal of a public goods administration is to ensure receipt of fair participation in a concrete [public goods game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game) while keeping the specific amounts private so as to not reveal the wealth of the individuals. With the advent of blockchain technology gross receipts can be cryptographically proven for a xpub key identity

## Currency

It is easily argued that commodity monies are insufficient for the operation of large scale economies.  At the same time, paper money requires a counterparty.  To mitigate the counterparty risk, this counterparty must maintain a standing military and police force to enforce various requirements on the use of money.

Both of these issues render a society based on voluntary participation impossible.  However, in 2009 we invented Bitcoin which is a cryptographic currency which has no counterparty risk, and allows for cryptographic verifiable of various things.
