# Hopelessness

Blessed are the hopeless, the failures, and those that underperformed. You will be made whole.

People love to ask "why?" Some people ask "why?" so much that it makes them sick. Given a reason, and they'll ask "why?" again. They fall into despair looking for meaning.

"Why?" implies that there is a reason, and reasons come from intentions. Who asks a rock "why are you a rock?" expecting an answer? Some things just are. The reason you are looking for comes from your own choices.

There is one important choice you must make (which all other things will follow from).  Will you seek to improve the universe, or will you seek to destroy it?  Even the meekest person can make progress towards either goal.
