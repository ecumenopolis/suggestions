# Hopelessness

1. Blessed are you if you are hungry, angry, lonely, tired, guilty, confused, sad, or hopeless. You know that you are lacking, and you will find the cure if you keep looking. Many do know, or care, what their problems are.
1. People enjoy asking "why?" Yet the question implies a reason, and reason implies intention. The ultimate intention is your own.
1. There is one important choice you must make (which all other things will follow from). Will you seek to improve the universe, or will you seek to destroy it?  Even the meekest person can make progress towards either goal.
1. Logic and existence are inseparable. Without logic, there are no reasons.
