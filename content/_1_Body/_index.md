# The Body

1. Your body is the temple of your mind. Therefore, take care of your body.
1. Don't eat food that has been left out for more than a few hours.
1. Wash your hands with soap before eating. If you eat with dirty hands, you risk consuming pathogens and getting sick.
1. Use utensils so that your hands do not touch the food.
1. Cook your food. Parasites and germs grow in food. Cooking it prior to eating will kill then, and also make the food more easily digested.
1. It is generally accepted that three meals a day is appropriate.
1. Your body requires a variety of nutrients. Eat a variety of foods so as to lessen the chance that your body lacks some critical nutrient. If some food seems to make you sick, see a doctor.
1. Don't eat so much as to be uncomfortable afterwards. It puts stress on your liver and organs and will negatively impact your health.
1. Liquid is to clean and lubricate your body. Would you bathe in Coke? Drink mostly water.
1. Avoid snacking. Food is to fuel your body and mind -- not recreation.
1. Wake up with the sun. Go to bed when you are tired.
1. Drugs and alcohol are sacraments, but poison in excess. They should only be taken with proper reverence. Leave them for shamans and priests to take when they fast.
1. Exercise several times a week. Invite others to exercise with you. Weight training build strong bones. Running strengthens your heart. Both set you up to age gracefully.
1. Keep your cloths clean, and bathe yourself. Otherwise you risk becoming diseased, and other people will not want to be around you.
1. Brush your teeth upon waking, and before going to sleep. Most cavities form overnight when your savilation decreases.
1. If you do not have your own home, then submit to the requirements of others so that they may give you shelter.
1. Put sex out of your mind until you are prepared to care for a child. Would you want to be without a father or  mother? Don't perpetuate neglectful abuse of children.
1. If you cannot put sex out of your mind, masterbate.
1. If masterbation doesn't suffice, then exercise extreme care with regards to whom you have sex. Human genitals can harbor germs and parasites which may not be curable. The risk of contracting and spreading them to others increases the more partners you have.
1. When society normalizes promiscuity, the risk of spreading these diseases increases dramatically.
1. Fasting cleans the soul, and the body. Try to fast for a day once a month. It provides an opportunity to clear out impurities, and dead cells, from your body. It also provides a space for meditation in gratitute for all you have.
1. If you are sick for more than a day, consult a doctor.
