Goods are materials that satisfy human wants and provide utility, for example, to a consumer making a purchase of a satisfying product. Public goods is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could be enjoyed without paying for it, and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others or the goods can be effectively consumed simultaneously by more than one person. This is in contrast to a common good which is non-excludable but is rivalrous to a certain degree. [^1]

The fact that these goods are non-excludable, gives rise to problem.  That problem has to do with the incentives to pay for public goods.  Given that public goods to have an expense to produce, but you need not pay to have access, then it does not make rational sense to pay for these goods.  However, if no citizens pay for public goods, then they may not be produced at all.  An economic modeling of this phenomenon occurs with the [public goods game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game).

As was discussed in the section on currency, this gives rise to violence.  This violence is produced by government, and forces individuals to pay for public goods.  Unfortunately, the specific allocation of money to public goods is then left up to government representatives.  This is economically inefficient, and in many cases ends up creating huge amounts of waste and burden on the populus.

The goal of this section is to propose a better way to allocate resources, and a mechanism to ensure that public goods are paid for, without the need for violence.  An additional goal, is to avoid the centralized allocation of resources so that information utilization may be maximized by our new "game." 

Historically, public goods have been disasterously underfunded without the use of violence to secure the currency, and to procure taxes. This means they are constantly suffering from funding shortfalls. However, we can create the proper incentives by using intolerance, rather than violence, to ensure public goods are funded.

We can accomplish this by creating a general fund which is managed by computer software.  Citizens will pay into this fund, and will be issued a receipt by the computer.  The funds provided to the software will be divided up to charities which have been decided by utilizing human [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence).  The specific mechanism for determining allocations is not at this time decided, however the basic premise is to allow citizens to "burn" something valuable in order to adjust the percentage-wise allocation of future donations to the general fund.

The receipts that the software issue will be usable for several things:

1. Spendable as part of a purchase for some percentage discount on products at merchants who choose to support this initiative.
2. They may be burned as a way for you to adjust what percentage of future funds go to which projects.
3. Cause new projects to be listed by burning receipts in a similar manner to #2.

The public goods administration will then also list merchants who choose to accept these receipts as a form of advertising. The intolerant minority can prefer these businesses, while also receiving a discount on products. This incentivizes merchants to participate, especially if they are ideologically aligned with the project.  The hope here is to cover the operational expenses of public goods.  For large capital expenditures, other fundraising mechanisms will be required.
