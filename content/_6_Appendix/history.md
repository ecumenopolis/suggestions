# In the beginning

As far back as we know, there existed everything-that-is uniquely and undivided. Then what we call the big-bang happened, and everything-that-is expanded into the forms we now acknowledge as the stars, the sun, the moon, and everythign else around us.  Eventually everything-that-is got bored and created man through a long process, which from our perspective, we call evolution.
