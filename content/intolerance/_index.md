## The power of intolerance

Nassem Talib has made a convincing argument for what he calls the [dictatorship of the minority](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15).  The basic premise is that if a minority of individuals within an economy is intolerant of products which do not meet certain requirements, and the rest do not have a preference, then all products will eventually meet these standards provided the cost to meet the standards does not outweigh the additional profit gained by serving 100% of the market.  He writes:

The minority rule will show us how it all it takes is a small number of intolerant virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly.

Therefore, those of us who take the commitment of this document should prefer to trade with others who have done the same.  They can do this in the form of giving discounts to people who can prove they are following these commitments.  This can be done through a cryptographically proveable membership card to a public goods administration which you choose to recognize.  Any public goods administration will do, provided it meets requirements that are laid out in a later section specifically on the operation of public goods administrations.
